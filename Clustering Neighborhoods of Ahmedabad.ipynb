There are around <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neighbourhoods_in_Ahmedabad'>**81  Neighborhoods**</a> in Ahmedabad. Each Neighborhood may have different popular venues, and thus if we can find similar neighbors and their popular venue categories, it may help Businesses in making Investment Decisions."

For example, Let's say we find that **Anand Nagar** is more famous for *Fast Food Restaurants* then this information could be helpful for an Organization/Investor who is looking for Investing in Fast Food Restaurant.

    "### Data\n",
    "First, we have to find out all the Neighborhoods of Ahmedabad. We will web scrape the data from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neighbourhoods_in_Ahmedabad'>this</a> Wikipedia page which contains the names of all the Neighborhoods of Ahmedabad. Next, we would need location data (coordinates) of each of these Neighborhoods, which we will get using the Geopy library. Lastly, we will pass these coordinates using Foursquare API to fetch the nearby venue details of each Neighborhood."
